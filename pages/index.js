          VISION - Each design should start with a clear vision of the wider practice aspirations and the specific client vision for their project.<br/>\
          COLLABORATION - We have a strong belief in a collaborative design approach which encompasses clients, related design disciplines, contractors and wider public engagement.<br/>\
          ENJOYMENT - At the core of the design process should be a sense of enjoyment. We firmly believe that the joy the designers feel during the creative process will be expressed into the places they create.'
